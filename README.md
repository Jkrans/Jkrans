### Jeremy Krans

**`Indie Full Stack Developer & Entrepreneur`**

I'm an Indie Full Stack Developer and Entrepreneur with a passion for creating interactive web experiences. As a recent computer science graduate, what I've been up to lately is channeling my love for coding, learning, and storytelling into designing virtual escape rooms for kids. With each project, I craft engaging narratives and blend them with user-friendly designs, building everything from scratch using React, CSS, HTML, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Express. My work also extends to image editing and story writing, adding a personal touch to the escape rooms I develop and sell access to online. 

I'm in the early stages of monetizing this passion. I manage the full lifecycle of my web applications, hosting backends on Railway and frontends on Netlify.

While I'm passionate about building my projects, I'm also open to exciting opportunities that can complement my journey. I am keen to collaborate, learn, and contribute in a professional environment while continuing to nurture my entrepreneurial endeavors. I'm eager to explore roles where I can apply my diverse skill set in full stack development and creative problem-solving.
